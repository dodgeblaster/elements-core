# Elements Core

Elements is a very unoriginal but good enough name for a collection of libraries
that help with making Javascript games on the web. If you are looking to make
js games, there are much better libs to use. The purpose of this lib is
for me to learn how things work at a lower level, and make it only what I need
to come up with ideas and game POC's quickly. Real games should probably be made with something like Unity3D.

This repo includes utils for:

-   canvas drawing
-   controller input
-   event bus
